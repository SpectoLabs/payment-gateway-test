# payment-gateway-test
This project is a mock payment gateway Java API, built in a similar way to PayPal or Strip APIs, and is used during the SpectoLabs
technical interview process.

#Your Task
Your task is to clone the repo and create a src **InMemoryPaymentService** class that allows the successful execution (and passing)
of all of the tests specified in the **PaymentServiceTest** test class.

This task should take between 30 - 60 minutes.

During the interview we will run ```mvn clean verify``` on the project and examine the successful test output and discuss
your implementation. At SpectoLabs we like [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882),
a good choice of algorithms and data structures, and the ability to debate your design decisions.

We will also suggest improvements to the **PaymentService** interface, and pair with you to write the associated tests and implementation.
